# Simple Pygame Movement

This project is a basic Pygame application that demonstrates how to create a window and move a rectangle using the arrow keys. User can press the arrow keys to move the rectangle Up, Down, Left, Right.

## Features

- Create a window using Pygame
- Move a rectangle (player) using arrow keys
- Basic object-oriented structure

## Use cases

This can be  used in various scenarios, particularly as a foundational piece for more complex applications. Here are a few potential use cases:

  1. **Game Development**:
     
       - This code can serve as a basic starting point for creating 2D games. You can expand it by adding more features like enemies, obstacles, scoring systems, and levels.
         
  2. **Educational Purposes**:
     
       - The code is simple and easy to understand, making it a great educational tool for teaching the basics of game development and programming concepts like object-oriented programming and event handling.
         
  5. **Prototyping**:
     
       - Developers can use this code to quickly prototype and test ideas for game mechanics or user interactions.
         
  7. **Interactive Simulations**:

       - The code can be adapted for creating simple interactive simulations or animations where user input controls movement or actions.
